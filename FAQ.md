Frequently Asked Questions
===========================

Why the name "linjark"?
------------------------

Well this project is developed in Linux and it aims at the linux user, so this should clear that bit up. 
Although it can be used in Mac and Windows (language model and Simon work there. The scripts would need portation tho.)

jar is just a reference to JARVIS who is a big inspiration in that project.

the k is from KDE as i use KDE 4 and Simon is also a KDE program.


What programs get installed?
-----------------------------

The install.sh does the following:
- creates .linjark for configuration files and modules
- downloads and installs MARRY TTS text to speech synthesizer into .linjark
- starts the MARRY TTS Component installer and displays INSTALL_DE so you can install the lang pack and Simon
- downloads the current GERMAN speech model in SBM format (for Simon)
- modifies the PATH variable, so Simon is able to execute scripts from .linjark/scripts/MODULE/bin
- lets you decide how you want the be adressed by your electronic butler
