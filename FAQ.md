Why the name "linjark"?
------------------------

Well this project is developed in Linux and it aims at the linux user, so this should clear that bit up. 
Although it can be used in Mac and Windows (language model and Simon work there. The scripts would need portation tho.)

jar is just a reference to JARVIS who is a big inspiration in that project.

the k is from KDE as i use KDE 4 and Simon is also a KDE program.
