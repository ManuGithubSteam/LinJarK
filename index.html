<a id="what-does-it-do-" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it ?</h1>

<p>It is your own personal electronic butler like in the Iron Man movies for your Linux desktop :-)<br><br>
To make this complex task somewhat easier for the average user, is the aim of this project.
<br> This is achieved with different software which is bundled together by me to make the whole experience somewhat user friendly.
 </p>

      <h1>
<a id="what-does-it-do-" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What languages are supported ?</h1>

<p>Simon/Linjark can support any language if there is a language model available and scenarios are written for it. 
<br><br>
Currently supported:<br>
- German (language model, marry voice and scenarios)
 </p>

      <h1>
<a id="what-does-it-do-" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What can I actually do?</h1>

<p>The tour shows some main features. <br>

<a href="tour1.html"><img src="tour_thumb.png" width="630" height="454" alt=""></a>
<br>
There are many more modules available. <a href="https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/LinJarK/tree/master/modules">Look into the modules section.</a>
<br>
For an in detail view what you can do, look into the <a href="https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/LinJarK/raw/master/linjark_grammar3.ods">grammar file of Linjark</a>

 </p>
      <h1>
<a id="what-does-it-do-" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Will you send my data to the Cloud</h1>

<p>
<b>Normally not. </b>Simon, the front-end of this little project uses the SPHINX language suite and tools. SPHINX does not use cloud computing to understand what you are saying, 
instead it relies on pre-formed sentences from different scenarios that you train. If you train a sentence enough it will understand you. After training it needs to recompile its 
language model locally on your machine.<br><br>

However there are some modules who will send data to the could because you can say a random word and it it not possible to form a pre-learned sentence with a random word.
<br><br>A good example is the translate module: It will rely on the pre-formed sentence: "Simon translate to spanish" when you speak that sentence simon will pick it up and 
after a ping sound you can say any random word. This will then be sent to Google. Google will return what you have said and Linjark will then translate this word into spanish.
<br><br>
Linjark will not listen into your home like other (commercial) solutions do. You can always decide not to use these modules anyway.<br>
Even the modules who require cloud computing are only started when you ask them and only about 4 seconds of sound/voice is recorded.<br>
If you don't believe it look into the code :-)

<h1>
<a id="how-does-all-this-work-" class="anchor" href="#how-does-all-this-work-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does all this work ?</h1>

<p>When you speak in your microphone, Simon, an open source speech recognition program is comparing your recorded voice with the data 
in the language model, if it finds the words in the model in the correct grammatical order, it can understand you if you trained it. <br><br>
Then it will launch some scripts according to what you say eg. 
check the weather for you. MarryTTS is then used to answer you with synthesized speech and display the requested information or read it back to you.</p>

This looks then something like this:<br><br>

<h1>
<a id="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Let's get started</h1>

<p>This git repository is set up with the goal of providing a <strong>more easy solution</strong> for German speaking people to control their PC, house or whatever 
with their voice with <em>open source and free solutions.</em></p>

<p><strong>However this stuff can also be adapted to any other language even other operating systems. As long as there is a language 
model with the words you need to control something for it.</strong></p>

<p>The more easiness comes in an <i>install.sh</i> that will install some of the components needed for successful speech recognition and provide guidance
 for installing the rest and also providing some Scenarios for Simon to use :-D.</em></p>

<p>Till now this is not really an easy task, mostly because the open source <strong>German</strong> language model does not support the right words 
for controlling applications and devices. But also because their are not many scenarios written for Simon and scripts to implement things in an 
easy way.

Jump right in and see the contents below :-)

<a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h1>

<b>ATTENTION:</b> Some modules are broken due to old age. Look for the most recent ones in the Github folder. I'm working on fixing the rest. 25/10/15<br><br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pretty good model is online, secarios and scripts can be made.</p>

<ul>
<li>The current model has many words for controlling and getting information of various sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Google Speech API v2 now requires personal keys, these modules will (for now) not work out of the box:</p>

<ul>
<li>Translation (translate words in other languages)</li>
<li>Internetsearch (search for something you said on the net)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This project is considered (again) active in development and not stable or bugfree!</p>



<h1>
<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aim of this project</h1>

<ul>
<li>Add missing words to the German open source language model. (already over 800 words added)</li>
<li>Write the scripts for the backend functions.</li>
<li>Write Scenarios for Simon in German to use the backend-scripts and the German language model.</li>
<li><p>Raise awareness of free, open source speech recognition, particularly the German model.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Further down the line, write a conkyrc script to implement "Rainmeter" like functionality for the Linux desktop.</p>

<ul>
<li>A graphics designer would be needed here for the background image! Please help if you can draw :-D</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get all of this stuff onto the Raspberry PI or a similar micro computer (ARM) for home automation.</li>
</ul>

<a id="trouble" class="anchor" href="#trouble-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trouble ?</h1>

<p>As this is for the German model I do obviously speak German and you can use that language if you contact me :-)</p>
