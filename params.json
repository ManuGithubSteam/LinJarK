{"name":"Linjark","tagline":"Using various technologies to bring easy speechrecognition/voicecontrol in (German) to Linux desktops and beyond","body":"What does it do ?\r\n=======\r\nIt is your own personal electronic butler like in the Iron Man movies for your Linux desktop. \r\nStatus\r\n=======\r\n- Pretty good model is online, secarios and scripts can be made.\r\n - The current model has many words for controlling and getting information of various sources.\r\n -> There are some things missing but this is normal as along the way some new things always get added......\r\n\r\n- As Google Speech API v2 now requires personal keys, these modules will (for now) not work out of the box:\r\n  - Translation (translate words in other languages)\r\n  - Internetsearch (search for something you said on the net)\r\n \r\n -> If you are interested, read the \"Get_GOOGLE_API_Key.md\" and give me some feedback how tey work for you :-D\r\n \r\nAlways check out: linjark_grammar#.ods for progress and the FAQ.md file\r\n\r\nThis project is considered active in development and not stable or bugfree!\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n========\r\nThis git repository is set up with the goal of providing a __more easy solution__ for German speaking people to control their PC, house or whatever with their voice with *open source and free solutions.*\r\n\r\n*The more easiness comes in an install.sh that will install some of the components needed for successful speech recognition and provide guidance for installing the rest and also providing some Scenarios for Simon to use :-D.*\r\n\r\nTill now this is not really an easy task, mostly because the open source __German__ language model does not support the right words for controlling applications and devices. But also because their are not many scenarios written for Simon and scripts to implement things in an easy way or another program who would scan the pocketsphinx output and launch some stuff (at least of that I know of). __This project will change that!__\r\n\r\n__However this stuff can also be adapted to any other language even other operating systems. As long as there is a language model with the words you need to control somehting for it.__\r\nHow does all this work ?\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nWhen you speak in your microphone, Simon, an open source speech recognition program is comparing your recorded speech with the data (words) in the language model, if it finds the words in the model, it can understand you. Then it will launch some scripts according to what you say eg. check the weather for you. MarryTTS is then used to answer you (default: in German) with synthesized speech and display the requested information with the scripts.\r\nGoal\r\n====\r\n- Add missing words to the German open source language model. (already over 800 words added)\r\n- Write the scripts for the backend functions.\r\n- Write Scenarios for Simon in German to use the backend-scripts and the German language model.\r\n- Raise awareness of free, open source speech recognition, particularly the German model.\r\n\r\n- Further down the line, write a conkyrc script to implement \"Rainmeter\" like functionality for the Linux desktop.\r\n  - A graphics designer would be needed here for the background image! Please help if you can draw :-D\r\n- Get all of this stuff onto the Raspberry PI or a similar micro computer (ARM) for home automation.\r\n\r\nInspiration\r\n============\r\nThis project is heavily inspired by the Iron Man movies and the speaking JARVIS computer. Also some inspiration is drawn from the J.A.R.V.I.S project for Microsoft Windows. (Who uses a non open source speech model to do his work!)\r\n\r\nJust check out Youtube for some videos etc. \r\n\r\nFor the English version of the language model / speech recognition check out Blather: https://gitorious.org/blather/pages/Home or Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr1FZ2F7KYA\r\n\r\n\r\nStructure / Used technologies\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n- Backend: language model\r\n- Middleware: Bash-scripts who do various things and MarryTTS\r\n- Frontend: Simon \r\n\r\nBACKEND: language model\r\n---------------------\r\nFor a PC to understand humans it needs to know how they sound and what words they use. It does that with a language model. It is the brain of this project :-D\r\nThere are two types of models that describe language - grammars and statistical language models. Grammars describe very simple types of languages for command and control, and they are usually written by hand or generated automatically with plain code (Simon scenarios). \r\n\r\nHowever, for now not even all command and control words are in the open source GERMAN language model.\r\n\r\nI use the German language model from Voxforge: http://voxforge.org/\r\n\r\nMore specific the on from Guenter: http://goofy.zamia.org/voxforge/\r\n\r\nI rely on Guenter to publish new language models (as they won't compile on my machine for some miraculous reason :-( ).\r\nI work actively with him to add new words into the model who can than be understood by Simon (speech recognition) and used for controling various things.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more about the whole model compilation business check out his awesome tools: https://github.com/gooofy/voxforge/\r\n\r\nMIDDLEWARE: bash scripts do the stuff .-)\r\n----------------------------------\r\nHere is most of the work for my purpose done. Get the local weather data and play it back to you, get some jokes from the net, switch on a lamp ??\r\nIt is all done here. I use bash scripts for this because they are easy to understand and to modify if the web page does change their information layout etc. Also they don't need much knowledge so many people can contribute.\r\n\r\nMarryTTS is used to generate spoken responses and output of the data collected. -> https://github.com/marytts/marytts\r\n\r\nFRONTEND: Simon\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nGreat program, it is very powerful and heart of this project! The dev is also really helpful and nice guy! \r\n__It handles all the basics like microphone calibration, recording what you are saying, comparing that with the language model and launching commands etc__\r\n\r\nOther than that I use Simon to do various things from me:\r\n\r\n- Break down the functionality of the scripts into modules (called Scenarios), so someone can only use the \"Search\" module and don't has to install all the other modules like Translation etc.\r\n- It is possible to train the speech model to your voice so it understands you (better) (very important!)\r\n- Provides and easy method to change the activation sentences to your likening\r\n- Can do many more things on its own without the scripts :-D\r\n\r\nCheck out Simon here: http://grasch.net/blog and here https://simon.kde.org/ \r\n\r\nYoutube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_9ImaiOISs&list=UUiVicBYegdFX9BnYOD2EMNw (quite old but you sould get the idea :-D)\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble ?\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAs this is for the German model I do obviously speak German and you can use that language if you contact me :-)\r\n\r\nPlease open a \"Issue\" here on github with a description what went wrong! Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to help !?\r\n==============\r\n\r\nJust get in touch!
