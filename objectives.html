<p>

The 2014 version on this project was mainly a merge of three different things:<br>
 It was a project for the many challenged people out there to help them work with Linux,
  but also a tool who was focused on the deskop user.
 In addition to that it was also aimed at the raspberry pi community.<br>
<br>
This approach did work well but it did not allow me to focus on the real potential and the things i want to work most.<br><br>

For this reason i have decided over the last few days that the Control Modules for various programs will not receive any updates.
Instead i will focus on the raspberry pi idea behind the project and also include some desktop elements.
<br>
<br>
This does not mean that linjark is of no use anymore for the handicapped people out there. 
It can still be used and I'm happy to include new modules here. But I will not develop them any further.
<br>
<br>
<ins>Here are some ideas for linjark on the pi modules</ins>
<ul>
1. Diashow module<br>
2. Remember todo this... module<br>
3. Traffic jam module<br>
4. Alarm clock module (with voice setting)<br>
5. Check for new mail<br>
6. Alert map module<br>
7. Science module<br>
8. Timer module	<br>
9. Appointment module
<br><br>
Hope you enjoy the ride like i do.
