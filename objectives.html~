<p>

The 2014 version on this project was mainly a merge of three different things:<br>
 It was a project for the many challenged people out there to help them work with Linux,
  but also a tool who was focused on the deskop user.
 In addition to that it was also aimed at the raspberry pi community.<br>
<br>
This approach did work well but it did not allow me to focus on the real potential and the things i want to work most.<br><br>

For this reason i have decided over the last few days that the Control Modules for various programs will not receive any updates.
Instead i will focus on the raspberry pi idea behind the project and also include some desktop elements.

<ins>For training the acoustic model to your speech:</ins>
<ul>
1. Start Simon<br>
2. Go to "<i>File</i>" and uncheck the box "<i>Connected</i>"<br>
3. On the bottom there should be: "<i><b>Disconnected</b></i>"<br>
4. Now select any training you want from the Training-field and click "<i>Start Training</i>"<br>
5. Do as many trainings as you like.<br>
6. Now <b>close Simon</b> with <i>Ctrl+Q</i> or "<i>File</i>" then "<i>Quit</i>"<br>
7. Now start the "<i>Simon_repair_training_data.sh</i>" script, it should be in your <i>HOME</i> directory. 
	You can just click on it. A message will display when the repair is finished.<br>
8. After the script is finished, <i><b>restart Simon</b></i> to start the recompilation of the acoustic model.	<br>
9. Wait..... and wait....
<br><br>
Have fun with your new model.
