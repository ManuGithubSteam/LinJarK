<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to train properly with Simon </h1>

<p>

To work around the bug with the wrong encoding of the sample-files, you are advised to train with Simon in this way.<br>
<br>
Also this approach will help reduce redundant/overlapping compiles (as Simon does normally recompile the model 
after each training session, even if you start another immediately afterwards) which in itself can lead to some strange errors. <br><br>

As the data for the model has then different states all the time the following compiles get screwed also this prolongs the time further 
for a successful recompilation of the speech model and clogs up you pc.<br>
<br>
<ins>For training the acoustic model to your speech:</ins>
<ul>
1. Start Simon<br>
2. Go to "<i>File</i>" and uncheck the box "<i>Connected</i>"<br>
3. On the bottom there should be: "<i><b>Disconnected</b></i>"<br>
4. Now select any training you want from the Training-field and click "<i>Start Training</i>"<br>
5. Do as many trainings as you like.<br>
6. Now <b>close Simon</b> with <i>Ctrl+Q</i> or "<i>File</i>" then "<i>Quit</i>"<br>
7. Now start the "<i>Simon_repair_training_data.sh</i>" script, it should be in your <i>HOME</i> directory. 
	You can just click on it. A message will display when the repair is finished.<br>
8. After the script is finished, <i><b>restart Simon</b></i> to start the recompilation of the acoustic model.	<br>
9. Wait..... and wait....
<br><br>
Have fun with your new model.

<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Common Errors</h1>
Ever seen this after a recompile of the model: <br>

<img src="gramer_error.png" width="464" height="454" alt="">

<br>

<b><ins>Reason:</ins></b> <br>

The reason for this is, that the grammar from a scenario can not be understood by Simon/SHPINX. The grammar structure gets more complicated with each added scenario. <br>
 <br>
 
 <b><ins>Solution:</ins></b> <br>
 
To solve this, <b>remove the scenario</b> with the wrong grammar and if it is a scenario from here, <b><a href="https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/LinJarK/issues" target="_blank">write a bugreport!</a></b>
<hr>
This is one of the most common errors for end-users, however there are more possible ones you can observe in the wild. <br>
