<p>

To get speech recognition you need basicly four things:<br>
<br>
<ul>A Language model that supports your said words<br></ul>
   <ul> Simon, the speech recognition programm<br></ul>
   <ul> MarryTTS the spreech systesizer to answer you<br></ul>
  <ul>  A Scenario for Simon, so some action can be done<br></ul>

This document will guide you through the install process. Everything (apart from Simon) is installed in .linjark in your HOME.<br>

First we will download the linjark script, that in turn will download and install MarryTTS and some other things. <br>Be aware that you still need to
 install Simon from your distribution repository.
<h2>Installation of linjark</h2>

<h4>Depencies:</h4>

Linkajrk depends on the following to function properly. Please install the necessay packages.<br>

wmctrl, xdotool, html-xml-utils, kdialog, sox, xclip<br><br>

<code>wmctrl xdotool html-xml-utils kdialog sox xclip</code>
<br>
    Download the Install.sh script and make it executeable:<br>

<code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ManuGithubSteam/LinJarK/master/install.sh</code><br>

<code>chmod +x install.sh</code><br>

    Start the script with "i" parameter to start Install<br>

<code>./install.sh i</code><br>

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Be aware that <i>"/home/$USER/.linjark/bin"</i> gets added to your $PATH var.<br>
Be sure that your .bashrc is called or .bash_profile gets executed on login, otherwise Simon will not function properly!<br> 
You can also add the Path to your /etc/environment. Check your distribution dokumentation for that!<br> <br> 

You can start Simon this way in a terminal:<br> <br> 

<code>PATH=\$PATH:/home/$USER/.linjark/bin simon</code><br> <br> 

<b>NOTE:</b> If you are not happy with the predefined words who are used to adress you (Sir or Miss) just edit .linjark/gender file and write in it waht you want eg. Lord
<h2>Installation of Simon</h2> 
<br> 
Use the repository of your distribution to install Simon (min version: 0.4.1).<br>  It is a KDE/QT programm and has KDE/QT
depencies among others used for speech model generation (sphinxtrain, sphinxbase etc).
<br> <br> 

For Gentoo this would be:<br> <br> 


USE Flags: kdepim, libsamplerate, nls, opencv, sphinx<br> 


<code>emerge simon pocketsphinx sphinx3 SphinxTrain</code><br> <br>

For Debain/Ubuntu based distros:<br>

<code>apt-get install simon sphinx3 sphinxtrain</code><br><br>

For Opensuse :<br>

Add the repository: "OpenSUSE Build Service: KDE:Extras" (in Community Repositorys)<br>

<code>zypper in simon</code><br>

Also install SphinxTrain from software.opensuse.org:<br>

http://software.opensuse.org/package/sphinxtrain?search_term=sphinxtrain<br><br>

Also make sure that your microphone is properly configured and seen/heard by simon and alsa etc. You can test this for example with Audacity :-D<br><br>

<b>See:</b>

<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Simon">https://userbase.kde.org/Simon</a> <br>
<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Simon/Handboo">https://userbase.kde.org/Simon/Handboo</a>k <br>
<a href="https://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=216">https://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=216</a><br>

In general it is a very good idea to read the handbook! Simon must work correctly for the speech recognition.<br>

If you compile it from source, make sure that +nls, +sphinx are compiled in!<br>
<h2>Installation of the language model in Simon</h2>

Navigate in Simon to "Configure Accoustic Model" -> "Open Model" -> "Import"<br>

Now navigate to you HOME there sould be an .sbm file. Import it.<br>

Tick the box: "Adapt base model using training samples"<br>

<b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that training and computing the model can take many hours (6-12 hours and more!!!) dependent on CPU and RAM.<br><br>

<b>TIP:</b> As Simon want to compile a new model every time you finished one training session it is a good idea to remove the tick in 
"File" "Connect to server". Then the model will not be compiled.<br><br>

When you are finished training the sentences of your scenarios (recognition rate should be above 30)<br>
Tick the box again and the model will compile with your speech patterns.<br>

<h2>Installation of Modules</h2>

Go into the modules folder on Github and download the module you want.

<a href="https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/LinJarK">https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/LinJarK</a>

Then extract it in your Home folder. The scripts will be automatically installed into the right folder.
<code>
tar xvf MODULE.tar.gz</code>

Open up Simon and click on "Manage Scenarios" -> "Open" -> "Import from file" then import the .scenario file from your HOME folder.

Check if there is a <b>READEME</b> file in your HOME folder and read it :-)
<h2>Use</h2>

It is most likely that you need to train Simon to your voice, otherwise it will not recognise your speech. To do that, use the provided training sentences in the modules.

A good recognition rate is about 30-50 but more is even better (100-120). This depends also on the spoken word, shorter words are harder to train.

Enjoy :-)
